This project utilizes OpenCV to create a video player application. It performs real-time object detection, focusing on pedestrians and individuals in wheelchairs within the video frames. The application offers features like starting, stopping, and pausing/resuming the video stream while displaying live counts of detected pedestrians and wheelchair users.
